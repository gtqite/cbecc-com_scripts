### REQUIRED PROGRAMS:
- Python 3.5 or later
	- Make sure the python path is created in the environmental values. 
- CBECC-com 2016 (3.0 recommended)
	- In "My Documents" -> "CBECC-com 2016 Data folder", Open CBECC-com16.ini in a txt editor.
	- In line 16, change "Developer Menu=" from 0 to 1. This unlocks developer mode which allows for batch processing.


### INSTRUCTIONS:
- Create a folder in your local drive and copy the contents of the batch processing tool folder.
	- Make sure you have the following file structure:
		- BaseModel (folder)
		- BatchProcess (folder)
			- _CBECC-com_Batch.xlsx
		- clearBatchProcess.py
		- modelCopy.py
- In the BaseModel folder, save the base CBECC-com 2016 models. 
	- Currently only works for .cibd16 models
	- The base models MUST be set to 0 deg orientation, set to Climate Zone 1 in ARCATA.
- Run modelCopy.py by double clicking the file or through the command prompt "python modelCopy.py" in the folder.
- In the BatchProcess folder, confirm that the base models were copied for all climate zones in all orientations.
- Open _filelist.csv and _CBECC-com_Batch.xlsx files. 
	- Copy the contents of filelist.csv to cell N16 of the _CBECC-com_Batch.xlsx.
	- Rename cell M8 to results file name.
	- (Optional) Change cells P16 to AD16 to change simulation options. The current setup is the default.
	- Save _CBECC-com_Batch as a .csv file in the same folder.
- Open CBECC-com 2016. 
	- Select "Select an Existing Project to Open" and click "OK".
	- Without selecting a file, click cancel. This allows you to open a blank CBECC-com file.
	- Go to "Tools" -> Batch Processing... and open the _CBECC-com_Batch.csv file.
- The simulation should begin.

- Once the simulations are complete, you should get a message saying "CMX_PerformBatchAnalysis_CECNonRes() returned 0". This means the models ran with no errors. Click "OK". 
- For some reason, CBECC-com will still be running in the background. Click Ctrl+Shift+Esc and under the "Process" tab, end the CBECC-com process.
- The results of the Batch process will be saved in the BatchProcess folder.
